# AI-Powered-Drawing-board
 
A versatile drawing board where users can sketch, customize brushes with different colors and stroke sizes, and add text to their artwork. Include options to clear the canvas, save drawings as images, and share creations easily. The interface should be smooth, intuitive, and fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

Bonus:
Integrate an API (e.g., Gemini API) to analyze drawings and identify objects. When users click 'Recognize,' the AI provides real-time feedback (e.g., 'This looks like a cat!') and displays it on the screen. Additionally, allow users to describe what they want to draw, and the AI provides guided suggestions or outlines to assist them.
